            Familiarity with <span>Undertale mechanics </span>(e.g.
            compositional elements, bullet-dodging, moral combat) helps
            comprehension.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Basic RPG terms: </span>HP, ATK, DEF, TP, EXP, and character
            levels—some adapted from Undertale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Awareness of chapter-based episodic narrative structure, including
            branching choices and different routes like the
            <span>Weird Route </span>

            The player controls <span>Kris, a non-binary human</span> teen from
            Hometown, who unexpectedly becomes a hero by entering a "Dark World"
            alongside classmates Susie and Ralsei.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each <span>chapter </span>has a self-contained storyline centered
            around sealing a Dark Fountain, while also building the larger
            narrative arc across chapters
          </p>
          <p>
            Chapter 1 introduces the <span>Dark World's </span>first throne and
            characters like Lancer and King. Chapters 2-4 offer broader worlds
            like cyber-themed areas, game-show segments, and the absurd humor
            Toby Fox is known for

            <span>Real-time overworld: </span>you can run by holding Cancel, or

            The game records <span>Completion Data </span>which carries items,
            characters recruited, and choices into subsequent chapters. If
            starting fresh, the game provides a default state with default gear
            and assumed pacifist conduct

            <span>Combat: </span>turn-based with options to Fight, Act, Item,
            Magic, Spare, or Defend. Enemies can be fought, spared, or scared
            off—EXPerence is not earned in Chapter 1 because no enemies die, but
            EXP starts appearing from Chapter 2 onward, especially on Weird
            Routes

            <span>Noelle: </span>A light-world classmate who joins the party in
