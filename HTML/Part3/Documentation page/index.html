          The player controls Kris, a non-binary human teen from Hometown, who
          unexpectedly becomes a hero by entering a "Dark World" alongside
          classmates Susie and Ralsei.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each chapter has a self-contained storyline centered around sealing a
          Dark Fountain, while also building the larger narrative arc across
          chapters
        </p>
        <p>
          Chapter 1 introduces the Dark World's first throne and characters like
          Lancer and King. Chapters 3-4 offer broader worlds like cyber-themed
          areas, game-show segments, and the absurd humor Toby Fox is known for
