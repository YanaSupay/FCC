            </li>
            <li>Became successful enough to run his own business</li>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Speech becomes a rapid and confusing mix of brazen deal-making,
            garbled nonsequiturs from online chain messages and advertisements,
            and out-of-context ramblings about his past
          </li>
          <li>
            Resembles a salesman's character, often seen trying to sell
            something or make a deal
          </li>
          <li>
            Has a tendency to use all-caps and bold text in his speech, giving
            him a frantic and erratic personality
          </li>
          <li>
            Has a small body, big eyes, and is usually surrounded by a glitchy,
            digital-like aura. His design is reminiscent of a puppet or a toy
          </li>
